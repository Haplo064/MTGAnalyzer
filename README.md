Getting  Started:

* Open this link. (https://www.wizards.com/Magic/PlaneswalkerPoints/History#type=EventsOnly)
* While in Chrome browser Press `ctrl+shift+j`
* In the console that opens run the command: `$("a.Expand").click()`
* Make sure you gave the previous command enough time to run! It takes a minute.
* Close the console.
* Press ctrl+a to select the data followed by ctrl+c to copy the data
* Paste the data into a text file, call it `mtg.txt`
* Run `MTG.exe`

You should now have two files, `games.csv` and `tournaments.csv` to wrangle the data with!
